# Financial RAG Eval Baseline

Frozen baseline for the local filings RAG retrieval and answer pipeline. Future
retrieval changes must beat or explain these numbers. Metrics are regenerated
locally; the underlying `artifacts/rag_eval/*` JSON/CSV are intentionally not
committed.

## Snapshot

- Date: 2026-05-31
- Branch: main
- Corpus: local cache only, 6 tickers, 48 filing documents, 2,922 chunks,
  2,922 Voyage embeddings (0 missing, 0 stale).
- Routing: deterministic (no LLM routing).

## Commands

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\financial_rag_expanded_retrieval_eval.py --top-k 5 --per-subquery-k 8
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\financial_rag_expanded_retrieval_eval.py --use-voyage --top-k 5 --per-subquery-k 8

## Retrieval Eval (30 cases, 7 companies incl. 1 unsupported-ticker control)

| Metric | Offline (lexical) | Voyage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Section/source hit rate | 0.933 | 0.933 |
| Metadata completeness | 0.967 | 0.967 |
| Evidence-quality pass rate | 0.967 | 0.967 |
| Gold Recall@5 | 0.625 | 0.625 |
| Gold MRR | 0.385 | 0.355 |
| Gold labels resolved | 29 | 29 |

Failure counts (both modes): `wrong_section_or_source` = 1, `unsupported_ticker` = 1.

- `unsupported-tsla-risk` is an intended negative control (TSLA not in corpus).
- `jpm-capital-return` is the one true retrieval miss — JPM has no cached EX-99
  exhibits, so capital-return commentary falls back to primary-filing wording.

## Answer Eval (16 cases, dry-run, no OpenAI calls)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Pass rate | 1.000 |
| Hallucinated citations | 0 |
| Uncited factual sentences | 0 |
| Weak/safe-harbor-only evidence cases | 0 |
| Evidence-quality pass rate | 1.000 |
| Gold Recall@5 | 0.714 |
| Retrieval errors | 0 |

## Corpus Coverage And Known Gaps

| Ticker | Chunks | EX-99 chunks | Press release | CFO commentary | Notable gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NVDA | 413 | 121 | yes | yes | no prepared remarks |
| AMD | 435 | 63 | yes | no | no CFO commentary |
| MSFT | 430 | 48 | yes | no | no CFO commentary |
| XOM | 403 | 93 | yes | no | no CFO commentary |
| AAPL | 194 | 10 | yes | no | thin EX-99 coverage |
| JPM | 1,047 | 0 | no | no | no cached EX-99 narrative at all |

- EX-99 / CFO-commentary coverage is uneven by issuer; only NVDA has cached CFO
  commentary. JPM has primary filings only.
- Non-NVDA section/source tuning is the next planned work; the lone retrieval
  failure (`jpm-capital-return`) reflects this gap.
- These numbers are the floor for the upcoming non-NVDA retrieval tuning and
  gold-label expansion work.
